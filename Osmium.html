<!--MAIN-->
<p class="intro">A shiny, silver metal that resists corrosion. It is the densest of all the elements and is twice as dense as lead. Osmium has only a few uses. It is used to produce very hard alloys for fountain pen tips, instrument pivots, needles and electrical contacts.

<h2 class="prop">Physical properties of Osmium are :</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Osmium is a bluish-white and shiny metal.</li>
<li>Osmium has the lowast vapor pressure and the highest melting point among the platinum group of metals.</li>
<li>Osmium's density is slightly more than iridium hence is credited as the heaviest element.</li>
<li>Osmium is very hard and is brittle even at very high temperatures.</li>
    </ol>
