<p class="intro">Protactinium is a chemical element with the symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a radioactive metal that has no stable isotopes. Protactinium was first discovered by Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth GÃ¶hring in 1913. The element is named after the Greek word "protos," meaning "first," as it was one of the first elements discovered that had no stable isotopes.</p>
