<!--MAIN-->
<p class="intro">Polonium is a rare and highly radioactive element that was first discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre in 1898. It is a silvery-gray metal that is similar in appearance to lead and bismuth. Polonium is produced in small quantities by the decay of radium and uranium, and it can also be artificially produced by bombarding bismuth with neutrons.</p>

<h2 class="prop">Physical properties of polonium are :</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Polonium is a radioactive, extremely rare semi-metal.</li>
       <li> it is fairly volatile: about half of a sample of it will evaporate within 3 days (unless it is kept in a sealed container).</li>
       <li>It is reactive, silvery-gray, it dissolves in dilute acids, but it is only slightly soluble in alkalis.</li>
       <li>Polonium is a rare and highly radioactive element that belongs to the group of chalcogens in the periodic table. </li>
    </ol>
