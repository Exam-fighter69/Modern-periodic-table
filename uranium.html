<p class="intro">Uranium is a naturally occurring element with the atomic number 92 and symbol U. It is a dense, silvery-white metal that belongs to the actinide series of elements. Uranium is found in small amounts in rocks, soil, and water and is primarily used for nuclear power generation and weapons. It is a radioactive element, meaning that it emits radiation as it decays over time. This radiation can be harmful to humans and the environment if not handled properly. </p>
