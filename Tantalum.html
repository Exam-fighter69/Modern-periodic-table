<!--MAIN-->
<p class="intro">Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73. It is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant and has a high melting point. The metal is also known for its ability to store and discharge electrical charges, which makes it a valuable component in electronics such as capacitors. </p>
<br><br>
<h2 class="prop">Physical properties of Tantalum are :</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity.</li>
       <li>The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids</li>
       <li>at temperatures below 150 Â°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia.</li>
       <li> lustrous appearance and is incredibly dense</li>
    </ol>
