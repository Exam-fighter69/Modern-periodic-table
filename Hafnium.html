<!--MAIN-->
<p class="intro">Hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol Hf and atomic number 72. It is a lustrous and silvery-white metal belonging to the transition metal group in the periodic table. Hafnium is closely related to zirconium, as they have similar chemical and physical properties, but they differ in their neutron absorption capabilities. Hafnium is known for its ability to absorb thermal neutrons, which makes it useful in nuclear reactors and control rods.</p>

<h2 class="prop">Physical properties of Hafnium are :</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>A shiny, silvery metal that resists corrosion and can be drawn into wires.</li>
       <li>It also has a very high melting point and because of this is used in plasma welding torches.</li>
       <li>Hafnium is a good absorber of neutrons and is used to make control rods, such as those found in nuclear submarines</li>
