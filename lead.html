<p class="intro">Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (derived from the Latin word plumbum) and atomic number 82. It is a soft, dense, bluish-gray metal that has been used for thousands of years due to its low melting point, corrosion resistance, and malleability.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 class="prop">Physical properties of Lead are :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lead is a bluish-white lustrous metal.</li>
        <li>It is very resistant to corrosion but tarnishes upon exposure to air.</li>
        <li> It is very soft, highly malleable, ductile, and a relatively poor conductor of electricity.</li>
        <li>Lead isotopes are the end products of each of the three series of naturally occurring radioactive elements.</li>
    </ol>
