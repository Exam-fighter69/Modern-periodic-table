<p class="intro">Radon is a chemical element with the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs naturally in the environment. Radon is formed from the decay of radium, which is found in soil, rocks, and minerals. It is the heaviest noble gas and is considered to be one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions.</p>
