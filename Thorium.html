<!--MAIN-->
<p class="intro">The element thorium was discovered in 1828. More than a 100 years later, in 1941, its potential as an energy source was proved. Thorium is estimated to be three to four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth's crust and it is one of the most energy dense elements found in nature.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 class="prop">Physical properties of Thorium are :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The melting point of thorium is 1,800째C (3,300째F), and its boiling point is 4,500째C (8,100째F).</li>
        <li>It is a silvery-white metal that is relatively soft and ductile, with a density that is lower than that of most other metals.</li>
        <li>It can be bent, cut, rolled, hammered, shaped or welded easily.</li>
        <li>The physical properties of thorium are similar to that of lead.</li>
    </ol>
